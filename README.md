# Day 3

Hi, This is your topic for the day

## Topic 
  
Today we will be revising the concept of OOP's (Object Oriented programming) which happens to be one of the most important concepts for a JAVA developer.

please go through the link below to understand/ revise what are OOPS. 

Link [Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/)

after having a complete understanding of what is oops let's go to daily task 3 to practice hands-on the concept of oops. 
in this task, we will take care of some of the oops concepts. 

### Daily Tasks 
  
### Question 1 

Topic : Inheritance / Overriding 	

 Create a base class Fruit which has name ,taste and size as its attributes. A method called eat() is created which describes the name of the fruit and its taste. Inherit the same in 2 other class Apple and Orange and override the eat() method to represent each fruit taste.

### Question 2 

Topic: Exception Handling: Try-catch Use multiple catch block 	


Write a program that takes as input the size of the array and the elements in the array. The program then asks the user to enter a particular index and prints the element at that index. Index starts from zero.
This program may generate Array Index Out Of Bounds Exception or NumberFormatException . Use exception handling mechanisms to handle this exception.
Sample Input and Output 1: Enter the number of elements in the array 2 Enter the elements in the array 50 80 Enter the index of the array element you want to access 1 The array element at index 1 = 80 The array element successfully accessed
Sample Input and Output 2: Enter the number of elements in the array 2 Enter the elements in the array 50 80 Enter the index of the array element you want to access 9 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Sample Input and Output 3: Enter the number of elements in the array 2 Enter the elements in the array 30 j java.lang.NumberFormatException
